I felt out so low
Felt nowhere to go
But I know you wait for me
You wait for me
So far out of sight
Straight into the white
But I know you wait for me
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights
But I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
Yeah, it's taken time to realize
But I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
Free falling from the high
I'm following the voice I know
Free falling from the high
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights
But I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
Yeah, it's taken time to realize
But I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
I'm coming home
I'm coming back down tonight
